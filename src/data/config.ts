    bio: "I’m Shloka Kamdar, a cloud and full-stack developer who enjoys building systems that actually work in the real world. I like working across the stack — from designing secure AWS infrastructure and automating deployments to building web applications with clean logic and thoughtful user flows. I learn best by doing, breaking things, fixing them, and understanding why they broke. I care about writing reliable systems, documenting my work clearly, and building solutions that are practical, scalable, and easy to maintain.",
